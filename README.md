# Project: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

 Project for Udacity's course: Python for AI Programmers

 In this project we had 2 main objectives:

Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images 
aren't of dogs

Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

Your program should have provided you with objectives 1 and 2 when 
it was run. In the table below, you will find our results for each 
of the model architectures. 

Compare the model architectures to find the best one.

For objective 1, notice that both VGG and AlexNet correctly 
identify images of "dogs" and "not-a-dog" 100% of the time.

For objective 2, VGG provides the best solution because it 
classifies the correct breed of dog over 90% of the time.
